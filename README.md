## Usage

`dropwizard-pac4j` provides two components which must be integrated into
applications:

- A configuration factory populated by values from a `pac4j` section within an
  application's config file.
- A Dropwizard [bundle](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.5/docs/manual/core.html#bundles)
  which:
    - connects the values defined in the `pac4j` configuration section to the
      [`jax-rs-pac4j`](https://github.com/pac4j/jax-rs-pac4j/) and
      [`jee-pac4j`](https://github.com/pac4j/jee-pac4j/) libraries.
    - enables the use of the annotation provided in by the
      [`jax-rs-pac4j`](https://github.com/pac4j/jax-rs-pac4j/) library.
    - enables Jetty session management by default.

### Dependencies (`dropwizard-pac4j` + `pac4j-*` libraries)

You need to add a dependency on:

- the `dropwizard-pac4j` library (<em>groupId</em>: **org.pac4j**, *version*:
**5.0.0**)
- the appropriate `pac4j` [submodules](http://www.pac4j.org/docs/clients.html)
(<em>groupId</em>: **org.pac4j**, *version*: **4.3.0**): `pac4j-oauth` for
OAuth support (Facebook, Twitter...), `pac4j-cas` for CAS support, `pac4j-ldap`
for LDAP authentication, etc.

All released artifacts are available in the
[Maven central repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cpac4j).

### Installing the bundle

Add the bundle within the application class' `initialize` method, just like any
other bundle:

```java
public class MySecureApplication extends Application<MySecureConfiguration> {
    final Pac4jBundle<MySecureConfiguration> bundle = new Pac4jBundle<MySecureConfiguration>() {
        @Override
        public Pac4jFactory getPac4jFactory(MySecureConfiguration configuration) {
            return configuration.getPac4jFactory();
        }
    };

    @Override
    public void initialize(Bootstrap<TestConfiguration> bootstrap) {
        bootstrap.addBundle(bundle);
    }

    ...
```

It can be useful to store the bundle in its own field in order to be able to
access pac4j configuration as shown at the end of the next section.

### Configuring the bundle

Update the application's configuration class to expose accessor methods for
`Pac4jFactory`:

```java
public class MySecureConfiguration extends Configuration {
    @NotNull
    Pac4jFactory pac4jFactory = new Pac4jFactory();

    @JsonProperty("pac4j")
    public Pac4jFactory getPac4jFactory() {
        return pac4jFactory;
    }

    @JsonProperty("pac4j")
    public void setPac4jFactory(Pac4jFactory pac4jFactory) {
        this.pac4jFactory = pac4jFactory;
    }
}
```

Note that it is also possible to have `pac4jFactory` be nullable and in this
case, pac4j won't be configured but pac4j's type will be readable in the
configuration. If the latter is not desired, do not use this bundle!

Add a `pac4j` section to a Dropwizard application's configuration file:

```yaml
pac4j:
  # those protect the whole application at Jersey level
  globalFilters:
    - matchers: excludeUserSession
      authorizers: isAuthenticated
  servlet:
    security:
      - ...
    callback:
      - ...
    logout:
      - ...
  matchers:
    # this let the /user/session url be handled by the annotations
    excludeUserSession:
      class: org.pac4j.core.matching.PathMatcher
      excludePath: ^/user/session$
  callbackUrl: /user/session
  defaultClient: DirectBasicAuthClient
  clients:
    - org.pac4j.http.client.direct.DirectBasicAuthClient:
        authenticator:
          class: org.pac4j.http.credentials.authenticator.test.SimpleTestUsernamePasswordAuthenticator
```

- `globalFilters` to declare global filters: the `clients`, `authorizers`,
`matchers`, and `skipResponse` properties directly map to
[the parameters](https://github.com/pac4j/jax-rs-pac4j/wiki/Apply-security)
used by `org.pac4j.jax.rs.filter.SecurityFilter`.

- `servlet` to declare servlet-level filters:
 - `security`: the `clients`, `authorizers`, and `matchers`
   properties directly map to
   [the parameters](https://github.com/pac4j/jee-pac4j/wiki/Apply-security)
   used by `org.pac4j.jee.filter.SecurityFilter`.
   The `mapping` property is used to optionally specify urls to which this
   filter will be applied to, defaulting to all urls (`/*`).
 - `callback`: the `defaultUrl`, and `renewSession` properties
   directly map to
   [the parameters](https://github.com/pac4j/jee-pac4j/wiki/Callback-configuration)
   used by `org.pac4j.jee.filter.CallbackFilter`.
   The `mapping` property is used to specify urls to which this filter will be
   applied to. It does not usually contains a wildcard.
 - `logout`: the `defaultUrl` and `logoutUrlPattern` properties directly map to
   [the parameters](https://github.com/pac4j/jee-pac4j/wiki/Logout-configuration)
   used by `org.pac4j.jee.filter.LogoutFilter`.
   The `mapping` property is used to specify urls to which this filter will be
   applied to. It does not usually contains a wildcard.

- `sessionEnabled`: set to `false` to disable Jetty session management.
If not set, the bundle will simply enable it by default.

- `matchers`: the key is the name of the `Matcher` and its instance is
declared as explained below.
Their name can be used in `filter`'s `matchers` as well as in the
`Pac4JSecurity` annotation.

- `authorizers`: the key is the name of the `Authorizer` and its instance is
declared as explained below.
Their name can be used in `filter`'s `authorizers` as well as in the
`Pac4JSecurity` annotation.

- `clients`: the key is the class of the `Client` and its instance
is configured based on the properties. Its name is by default the short
name of its class, but it can also be set explictly.
Their name can be used in `filter`'s `clients` as well as in the
`Pac4JSecurity` annotation.

- `defaultClient`: the name of one of the client configured via `clients`.
It will be used as the default pac4j `Client`. Pac4j exploits it in particular
when no client is specified during callback, but also when no clients are
specified on a security filter.

- `defaultClients`: the names (separated by commas) of some of the clients
configured via `clients`. They will be used as the default value for the
`clients` parameter of the `Pac4JSecurity` annotation.

To specify instances of `Client`, `Authenticator`, `PasswordEncoder`,
`CredentialsExtractor`, `ProfileCreator`, `AuthorizationGenerator`,
`Authorizer`, `Matcher`, `CallbackUrlResolver`, `HttpActionAdapter`
and `RedirectActionBuilder`, it only necessary to refer to their class name
using the `class` key as above and the other properties are set on the
instantiated object.

#### URLs Relativity

Note that all urls used within Jersey filters are relative to the dropwizard
`applicationContext` suffixed by the dropwizard `roothPath` while the urls used
within Servlet filters are only relative to the dropwizard
`applicationContext`.

For Jersey, this also includes `callbackUrl`s, enforced by
`JaxRsCallbackUrlResolver`, which is the default`CallbackUrlResolver` in the
config if not overridden.

#### Advanced Configuration

For more complex setup of pac4j configuration, the Config can be retrieved from
the Pac4jBundle object stored in your `Application`:

```java
public class MySecureApplication extends Application<MySecureConfiguration> {

    final Pac4jBundle<MySecureConfiguration> bundle = ...;

    @Override
    public void run(MySecureConfiguration config, Environment env) throws Exception {
        Config conf = bundle.getConfig()
        
        DirectBasicAuthClient c = conf.getClients().findClient(DirectBasicAuthClient.class);
        c.setCredentialsExtractor(...);
        
        env.jersey().register(new DogsResource());
    }
}
```

### Securing REST endpoints

From here, `jax-rs-pac4j` takes over with its annotations. See `pac4j`
documentation on how to implement `Client`s, `Authorizer`s, `Matcher`s and all
the other points of extension.

* [pac4j's website](http://www.pac4j.org) and
  [README](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j)
* [`jax-rs-pac4j`'s README](https://github.com/pac4j/jax-rs-pac4j)

### Usage with Dropwizard's ResourceTestRule

When using `ResourceTestRule`, it usually make sense to mock the profile that
is injected for `@Pac4jProfile` annotations by using one of the alternative
`Pac4JValueFactoryProvider` binders:

```java
@Rule
public final ResourceTestRule resources = ResourceTestRule.builder()
      .addProvide(MyResource.class)
      .addProvider(new Pac4JValueFactoryProvider.Binder(new CockpitProfile("my-mock-user-id")))
      .build();
```
